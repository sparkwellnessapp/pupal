# RUNLOG — grading eval suite (append-only hard memory)

Every run and every variable change gets an entry (hypothesis, variable,
pre/post, attribution, decision, cost). An analysis is not done until its
entry exists. Read this file at the start of every iteration.

## CHANGE 2026-08-24 — Phase A: the instrument exists (zero spend)

what: suite skeleton per MISSION v0 — schemas (FixtureGT/TrialScore), fixtures
  (manifest pairing [F3], hash pins [D5], GT guards [SS5], R1 blind sequencing),
  scoring (Tier-0..3 per SS6/SS7; [T1-*] tripwires; [DL-1/2/3] operational
  definitions), reporting (worst-test-first, PROVISIONAL stamps, ECE n-flagged),
  runner (grade | score_only | --scopes; 300s wall + exactly one transport
  re-run [D7]; DL-4 model-pin refusal; provenance incl. suite_hash covering
  snapshots + shared registry [D3]), configs/gpt-4o.json (deployed pin, $0.10
  ceiling), eval_common dry-resolve extension, fixture tools (F0 staged
  proposal, F1 converter with 5/5 parity, F2 rebuild, F4 skeleton), docs
  (ONBOARDING, PLAYBOOK with STOP list, GT_CONVENTIONS skeleton with C-1..C-5).
why: MISSION SS11 Phase A. Failing-test-first: red captured with the
  implementation absent (ModuleNotFoundError x3 collection errors), then
  44 passed / 1 xfailed (the eval_common D5 sentinel).
evidence: PHASE_A_REPORT.md (proofs per item). Guards include the known-answer
  self-pass and one injected-error test per metric [SS10]. Zero API calls in
  pytest -q (verified: no OPENAI key needed for the battery).
affects: suite_hash exists from this commit; F0 correction proposal STAGED in
  H1_CORRECTION_PROPOSAL.md — [STOP] awaiting owner ratification [R5/H1].
  Phase B blocked on H1 + C-1..C-5 rulings + owner blind grading [F5/R1].
corrections: none

## CHANGE 2026-08-24 — Phase B: C-2 Tier-2 exclusion + item-6 reporting (INSTRUMENT change, owner-ruled)

what: (1) scoring [C-2, ratified]: ungradable-scope terminals now EXCLUDED from
  all Tier-2 agreement metrics (MAE / within-precision / exact / edit_burden /
  compensating-error input) and from the calibration input; best-guess awards
  participate in TOTALS only (score_with_selection). TerminalScore gains
  ungradable_scope + gt_note. Tier-1 ungradable-guess tripwire UNCHANGED.
  (2) reporting [item 6]: fixture report displays the GT note column
  ([C1-TABLE] terminals visible to the read-by-hand ritual) + the
  "total includes N ungradable-scope terminals" mark; per-fixture Tier-3
  counts c1_table_terminals + ungradable_terminals.
why: Phase-B ruling items 4 + 6 (verbatim text in GRADING_GT_CONVENTIONS.md).
protocol: failing tests FIRST (4 red: 2 scoring + 2 reporting), then
  implementation, then 48 passed / 1 xfailed. Calibration exclusion is an
  agent judgment EXTENDING the ruling's logic (best-guess correctness is
  noise) — documented in PLAYBOOK SS4, flagged for reviewer.
affects: suite_hash SHIFTS (scoring/reporting/schemas + new snapshots) —
  harmless pre-baseline (no baseline exists). No sibling files touched.
corrections: none

## CHANGE 2026-08-24 — Phase B: fixtures land (F0 ratified -> F2/B3 -> B4)

what: sibling GT edits committed FIRST (6337fbc, owner-attributed:
  din_ezra.md + yonatan_basiuk.md — snapshots point at committed state);
  F1 parity re-run POST-commit: 5/5 byte-identical (evidence hygiene);
  H1 RATIFIED -> benchmarks/contracts/hobby_tvshow_corrected.contract.json
  + .provenance.json (ratified_by Noam, 2026-08-24, DL-5 + DL-6 accepted);
  F2: 5 transcription contracts snapshotted (6 answers each) + B3: 5
  per-fixture manifests with sha256 pins; B4: 5 GT skeletons emitted for
  the owner's blind grading.
why: Phase-B ruling items 1/2/7, executed in the ruled order.
affects: [STOP] F5 — owner blind-grades from the skeletons [R1]. No
  grade-mode run exists or may exist before GT lands. Phase C gated on P2.
corrections: none
