Look at this handwritten code page and transcribe it.

=== STEP 1: IDENTIFY (fill visual_grounding FIRST) ===
Read the page carefully. What class name do you see after the word "class"?
What method names can you physically see written?

=== STEP 2: TRANSCRIBE (fill transcription SECOND) ===
Copy the code CHARACTER BY CHARACTER. The class name you write MUST match what you identified in Step 1.

  "visual_grounding": {
    "class_name": "The EXACT word written after 'class' (copy letter by letter) or null",
    "method_names": ["list each method name you can physically see"],

=== VALIDATION BEFORE RESPONDING ===
✓ Check: Does the class name in answer_text match visual_grounding.class_name?
✓ Check: Did you preserve typos, missing semicolons, and errors?
✓ Check: Are you transcribing what's written, not what's expected?
