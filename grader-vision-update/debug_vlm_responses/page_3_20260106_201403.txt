Look at this handwritten code page and transcribe it.

=== STEP 1: IDENTIFY (fill visual_grounding FIRST) ===
Read the page carefully. What class name do you see after the word "class"?
What method names can you physically see written?

=== STEP 2: TRANSCRIBE (fill transcription SECOND) ===
Copy the code CHARACTER BY CHARACTER. The class name you write MUST match what you identified in Step 1.

{
  "visual_grounding": {
    "class_name": "The EXACT word written after 'class' (copy letter by letter) or null",
    "method_names": ["list each method name you can physically see"],
    "field_names": ["list variable names you can see"],
    "approximate_lines": 0
  },

        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ]
  }
}

=== VALIDATION BEFORE RESPONDING ===
✓ Check: Does the class name in answer_text match visual_grounding.class_name?
✓ Check: Did you preserve typos, missing semicolons, and errors?
✓ Check: Are you transcribing what's written, not what's expected?

    Confidence: 0.95
    Code:
      Employee[] arr = dep.GetAVREmployee();
      int curr = dep.GetCurrent();
      for (int i=0; i<curr; i++)
      {
        salary = arr[i].GetSalary();
        if(arr[i].GetIsSenior())
          salary = salary*1.33;
        sum = salary;
        return sum;
      }
